'm Junie! Nice to meet you. I'm not very active here since I'm not that skilled at developing projects. But when I do create something, I'll be sure to post it here! I mostly make programs for Linux, many of which are inspired by others. I also plan to post tutorials for newcomers to Linux, specifically on tiling window managers and Wayland gaming.

I owe my entire desktop setup to [Prasanth Rangan](https://www.github.com/prasanthrangan) I highly recommend you check out his work!!! He's actually the person that inspired me to originally switch from windows to Linux! I use Prasanth Rangans dotfiles which can be found -> [here](https://github.com/prasanthrangan/hyprdots) I also use a similiar configuration on my laptop! But i use [ML4W](https://github.com/mylinuxforwork) dotfile's! These can be found [here](https://github.com/mylinuxforwork/dotfiles) again another amazing creator who does way too much for the community please check them out as well!

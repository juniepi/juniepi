'm Junie! Nice to meet you. I'm not very active here since I'm not that skilled at developing projects. But when I do create something, I'll be sure to post it here! I mostly make programs for Linux, many of which are inspired by others. I also plan to post tutorials for newcomers to Linux, specifically on tiling window managers and Wayland gaming.

**`Tutorials / Simple Qaulity of Life Scripts`**

As I mentioned when I greeted you ^^, thank you for staying <33! I plan to release projects that address some of the issues Nvidia has with Wayland, along with quality of life improvements I discover. I also want to create tutorials for newcomers to Linux who, like me, couldn't find answers in the various buried forum posts <33!

I owe my entire desktop setup to [Prasanth Rangan](https://www.github.com/prasanthrangan). I highly recommend you check out his work!!! He’s actually the person who inspired me to switch from Windows to Linux! I use Prasanth Rangan's dotfiles, which can be found -> [here](https://github.com/prasanthrangan/hyprdots). I also use a similar configuration on my laptop, but I use [ML4W](https://github.com/mylinuxforwork) dotfiles! These can be found [here](https://github.com/mylinuxforwork/dotfiles). Again, another amazing creator who does so much for the community—please check them out as well!

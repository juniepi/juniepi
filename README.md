# üå∏ Junie Pie

**`Linux enthusiast/ CyberSecurity Student`**

I'm junie! nice to meet you I'm barely active here since I'm not that good a developing projects. But when i do develop something I'm sure to post it here! I mostly make programs for Linux most of which are inspired by others! I also plan on posting tutorials for new people to Linux specifically tiling managers and Wayland gaming ^^ 

## üßê What Projects will be posted here? 
**`Tutorials / Simple Qaulity of Life Scripts`**

Like i touched on a bit while i greeted you ^^ thanks for staying btw <33 I plan on releasing projects that will help some issues Nvidia has with Wayland along with just quality of life improvements i can find along with tutorials for people new to Linux who were like me who couldn't find their answer in the various buried forum posts <33!

I owe my entire desktop setup to [Prasanth Rangan](https://www.github.com/prasanthrangan) I highly recommend you check out his work!!! He's actually the person that inspired me to originally switch from windows to Linux! I use Prasanth Rangans dotfiles which can be found -> [here](https://github.com/prasanthrangan/hyprdots)

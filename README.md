#  🌺 Junie Pie 






**`Linux enthusiast/ CyberSecurity Student`**

I'm junie! nice to meet you I'm barely active here since I'm not that good a developing projects. But when i do develop something I'm sure to post it here! I mostly make programs for Linux most of which are inspired by others! I also plan on posting tutorials for new people to Linux specifically tiling managers and Wayland gaming ^^

I owe my entire desktop setup to [Prasanth Rangan](https://www.github.com/prasanthrangan) I highly recommend you check out his work!!! He's actually the person that inspired me to originally switch from windows to Linux! I use Prasanth Rangans dotfiles which can be found -> [here](https://github.com/prasanthrangan/hyprdots)
